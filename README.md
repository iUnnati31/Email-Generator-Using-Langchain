## Email Generator Using Langchain

# Overview
This project focuses on generating emails based on user inputs using the Langchain framework and the ChatGroq LLM model. The goal is to provide users with a tool to create emails by specifying the subject, recipient, content, and style (formal or informal).

# Data
The project uses user inputs for email subject, recipient, content, and style to generate the desired email. These inputs are provided through a user-friendly interface built with Streamlit.

# Model
The ChatGroq LLM model is used to process the inputs and generate the email content. The model leverages the capabilities of Langchain to ensure coherent and contextually appropriate email generation.

# Usage
- Input Parameters: Provide the email subject, recipient, content, and choose the email style (formal or informal) via the Streamlit interface.
- Email Generation: The Langchain framework processes the inputs using the ChatGroq LLM model to generate the email.
- Output: The generated email is displayed on the Streamlit interface. Outputs for both formal and informal styles can be compared.
  
# Results
The project aims to provide accurately generated emails that meet the specified style and content requirements. Outputs for both formal and informal styles are included for demonstration purposes.
